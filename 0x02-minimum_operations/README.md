 Initialization: Start with one 'H' and initialize counters for operations and the clipboard.
Loop Until Target: Continue until the number of 'H's meets or exceeds the target n.
Copy and Paste Strategy:
If no data is copied, perform "Copy All" followed by "Paste" to double the count, which takes two operations.
If the remaining target count is a multiple of the current count, perform a "Copy All" followed by a "Paste", increasing the count significantly in one go.
Otherwise, just "Paste" to gradually increase the count.
Efficiency: This approach ensures that each step either maximally increases the count or progresses towards the target efficiently, minimizing the number of operations.
This solution efficiently determines the minimum operations by leveraging the properties of multiples and prime factors, ensuring optimal performance even for larger values of n.
