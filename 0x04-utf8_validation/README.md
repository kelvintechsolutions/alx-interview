# UTF-8 Validation Project

## Overview

This project contains a Python solution for validating UTF-8 encoding from a given list of integers, where each integer represents a byte of data.

## Files

- `0-validate_utf8.py`: Contains the `validUTF8` function, which checks if the provided data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- `0-main.py`: A test file for demonstrating the usage of the `validUTF8` function with various data sets.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and guide to the project.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 (version 3.4.3 or compatible) installed.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.
4. Execute the test file using Python: `./0-main.py` (on Linux/macOS) or `python 0-main.py` (on Windows).
5. Observe the output for each test case, indicating whether the data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Notes

- This solution adheres to PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x).
- All files are set to be executable and end with a new line, as per the requirements.
- The project is compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
